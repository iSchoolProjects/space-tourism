### Hello dear contibutor,

thanks for effort on this sweet project, we really appreciate it.

#### As in any project, we would need to follow some set of rules as:

- All code contributions should come via pr
- We should try to keep commits as small as reasonably possible
- Bootstrap to be used
- No js could be used
- No overriding of bootstrap
- Minimize custom css
- proper naming convetion to be in place
- no overloading with classes, let's find better approach
- we will go with mobile first approach
